this is to just check if we created a readme file after generatting the files on local machine then will this be automatically shown on th e computer or we had to take some steps
so we learnt that we used the : git pull origin main command to  update the changes on the local server ffrom the global server.
finally we checked what and how to use th branching feature
first i created a branch named new branch  by git checkout -b new-branch
all the changes are committed to this branch and pushed to this branch
if the project works fine then we can checkout adn merge this branch
finally if everything works fine  and the brancch is no longer needed then we may delete this branch 
git branch -d new-feature
